'20Mar95 CKJ Added progsdrv
'23Mar95 CKJ Close changed
'04May95 ASC New ATC link completed and tested at Watford

'03Jun97 KR CallIPDList: Now get wards from supplier file.  Use SelectWards procedure to display ward list.
'18Jun97 KR Fixed spelling mistake in variable name: DosesForIs2sue!  in CallIPDList.
'03Jun97 KR CallIPDList: Fixed subscript out of range error - ward array was not being filled!
'           As now password protected, set the userid when writing to the translog.
'31Oct97 EAC CallIPDList: use the correct array to pull ward codes from
'20Jan98 CKJ CallIPDList: Added k.escd=True if pt not found
'20Jan98 CFY CallIPDList: Added code for blister packing
'21Jan98 CKJ CallIPDList: Now only processes blister packs if selected by the user

'17Feb98 CFY CallIPDList: Changed code which determined the start and end times for blister packing
'02Mar98 CFY CallIPDList: Added extra conditions when calling 'PrintDetails' when Blister packing.
'                         Now when blister packing is selected, only the drugs which have been packed
'                         are shown on the report.
'05Mar98 CFY CallIPDList: New parameter added to shellsort
'16Mar98 CFY CallIPDList: Now reads ini file setting in patmed.ini to determine whether or not an editable
'                         preview of the blister pack should be shown.
'17Mar98 CFY CallIPDList: Now takes value of the Book-Out Check box and passes to the blister routines
'                         to indicate whether or not to issue stock.
'                         Extra condition added to stop drugs being booked out by the ipdlist routines when
'                         the blister check box is checked and the book out check box is checked. This is due to
'                         the fact that the blister routines handle the booking out of blister packed drugs themselves
'                         Also added assignment of pid.caseno to the global var gTlogCaseno$ so that the translog can
'                         write the caseno rather than the pid.recno to the log.
'15Apr98 ASC/CKJ issueunits changed to printformV when printing
'20Apr98 CKJ PrintDetails & ActionEachDose: reinstated Ltime$(x) with correct element name
'25Jun98 CFY ActionEachDose: Corrected calculation of quantities on labels. Now no longer divides by the
'            doses per issue unit.
'29Jun98 CFY ActionEachDose: Corrected quantity calculation. Now works correctly with both DSS and non DSS
'            drug data.

'14Sep98 CFY CallPickList: Written
'14Sep98 CFY SplitFile: Written
'14Sep98 CFY BuildIssueTypes: Written
'19Nov98 CFY ActionEachDoes: Changed order in which labels are printed. Previously printing occured in the
'            following order : (formula/worklabel), dispensing label, bag label. This has now
'            been chaged to  : dispensing label, (formula/worklabel), bag label. The reason
'            for this is due to the fact that printing of worksheets for multiple patients requires
'            the label to be generated first in order to duplicate the information on the worksheet.
'            Also moved call to PrintWorkLabel to outside the main loop. This is to prevent a worksheet
'            being printed for every dose.
'19Nov98 CFY CallIPDList: Added call to PromptForWrkSht if doing a CIVAS item.
'            Now also does an additional call to PrintManWorksheet at end of process incase
'            there are still patients on the heap waiting to be parsed and printed.
'26Jan99 CFY CallIPDList: Corrected mod of 03Aug98
'24Feb99 SF  CallIPDList: traps for the user cancelling out at various times
'24Feb99 SF  ActionEachDose: added and sets escd% parameter
'15Mar99 SF  CallIPDList: made mods for repeat dispesning
'15Mar99 SF  CallIPDList: now if no patients on a ward displays that ward's code and name
'01Apr99 SF  CallIPDList: bumped up number of patients handled from 100 to 200 repeat dispensing
'07Apr99 SF  CallIPDList: changed the redim of array patsort$ from 100 to 200 for repeat dispensing

'14May99 CFY CallIPDList: Now Correctly parses all standard header information when doing a screen preview.
'04Jun99 CFY CallIPDList: Now generates the batch number fo CIVAS products before generating the labels
'             so that the number can be prointed on the label.
'07Jun99 SF  CallIPDList: now opens/closes "patid.mdb" only once to speed up batch processing in repeat dispensing
'28Jul99 AE  ActionEachDose: Added block to print extra civas / manufacturing labels from prescription manager
'06Sep99 CFY ActionEachDose: Change to fucntionality fucntionality of Extra CIVAS labels. Can now have extra labels
'             either per batch or per dose.
'10Dec99 SF  CallIPDlist: now allows the maximum patients per ward to be ini file specified (default is the original 200)
'24May00 AJK PrintDetails : Now passes the ward description though to be printed on print Header
'25Oct99 CFY CallPickList: Additional condition added to filter cancelled transactions.
'02May00 CFY CallPickList: Displays error lines on report if the product cannot be found for a particular transaction
'              Also changed formatting of qty to display only 2dp rather than 3dp.
'12oct01 CKJ CallIPDlist: Added separate frame for patient status & removed link between repeat dispensing and label types
'12Nov01 TH  CallIPDlist: Various changes to look up specific ward details if using patient specific search.
'   "        NB - quick changes for release - overhaul of this still required for 8.5 (#56702)
'14Feb02 TH  CallIPDlist: Added code to allow sort by consultant only if requested by user (option formally ignored) (#49045)
'25Feb02 TH  CallIPDlist: Changed to flag not to reference dispens.frm (#59050)
'01Jun02 All/CKJ Added option explicit & corrected resulting issues
'15Oct02 TH  CallIPDlist: Added flag to stop translog write if manu issue and ActionEachDose has already been called (#)
'16Oct02 TH  CallIPDlist: Moved calls to promptBatchno on civas issue to point where the issue will take place (ie after checks on exclusions) (#)
'21OCt02 TH  CallIPDlist: Mod to suppress 'OK to print msg' (cant cancel at this point) and to add patient details to batchno prompt caption during manu issue
'21Oct02 TH  ActionEachDose: Added calls to put batchnumber and expirydateonly to heap
'13Nov02 CKJ CallIPDlist: Moved call to PromptBatchNumber inside ActionEachDose. Only allocate batchno when there is at least one dose to be handled.
'             If ActionEachDose finds that enough doses have been done already then it would have wasted that batchno
'             Added support for detecting whether a formula has been handled internally by manufacturing
'            ActionEachDose: Allocate batch number only when at least one civas dose is needed
'             Don't print extra labels unless at least one dose has been found
'             Added support for detecting whether a formula has been handled internally by manufacturing             (#64623)
'14Feb03 CKJ Removed ATC.INC from project and moved the two structures here
'            Gauge 'GgeDone' is set from CallIPDlist but the form is never visible at this time. Removed reference
'            to the guage control & removed it from the project.
'29Sep04 TH  CallIPDlist: Added mod to check each label and set to history if date past stop date. These labels will not now be processed.
'05Sep05 PJC/TH CallIPDlist: Added a test for AutoArchive to the logic in the If statement (#79161).
'12Jan07 PJC    CallIPDlist: Added extra empty arguments to the call to PrintManWorksheet (enh77351).

'Sub CallIPDlist(frmIPD As Form)
''04Nov96 KR Added ucase around comparison of case number.
''           Replaced brackets so that they were correct
''03Jun97 KR Now get wards from supplier file.  Use SelectWards procedure to display ward list.
''18Jun97 KR Fixed spelling mistake in variable name: DosesForIs2sue!
''03Jun97 KR Fixed subscript out of range error - ward array was not being filled!
''           As now password protected, set the userid when writing to the translog.
''31Oct97 EAC - use the correct array to pull ward codes from
''20Jan98 CKJ Added k.escd=True if pt not found, otherwise gauge control fails
''20Jan98 CFY Added code for handling blister packs
''21Jan98 CKJ Made blister packing only happen if selected by the user
''17Feb98 CFY Changed code which determined the start and end times for blister packing
''02Mar98 CFY Added extra conditions when calling 'PrintDetails' when Blister packing.
''            Now when blister packing is selected, only the drugs which have been packed
''            are shown on the report.
''05Mar98 CFY New parameter added to shellsort
''16Mar98 CFY Now reads ini file setting in patmed.ini to determine whether or not an editable
''            preview of the blister pack should be shown.
''17Mar98 CFY Now takes value of the Book-Out Check box and passes to the blister routines
''            to indicate whether or not to issue stock.
''            Extra condition added to stop drugs being booked out by the ipdlist routines when
''            the blister check box is checked and the book out check box is checked. This is due to
''            the fact that the blister routines handle the booking out of blister packed drugs themselves
''            Also added assignment of pid.caseno to the global var gTlogCaseno$ so that the translog can
''            write the caseno rather than the pid.recno to the log.
''03Aug98 TH  Added line to file/printout totalling drugs for each ward and giving a grand total
''            whenever a specific drug is entered.
''03Aug98 TH  Rft printing now by contexts (hedit14)
''21Aug98 CFY Corrected quantity calculations that are written to the log.
''02Sep98 TH  Previewedit option on blisterpack printing now from chkbox not ini setting
''19Nov98 CFY Added call to PromptForWrkSht if doing a CIVAS item.
''            Now also does an additional call to PrintManWorksheet at end of process incase
''            there are still patients on the heap waiting to be parsed and printed.
''26Jan99 CFY Corrected mod of 03Aug98
''24Feb99 SF  traps for the user cancelling out at various times
''15Mar99 SF  made mods for repeat dispesning
''15Mar99 SF  now if no patients on a ward displays that ward's code and name
''01Apr99 SF  bumped up number of patients handled from 100 to 200 repeat dispensing
''07Apr99 SF  changed the redim of array patsort$ from 100 to 200 for repeat dispensing
''26Apr99 SF  removed hourglass when warning user that there are no patients on a ward
''14May99 CFY Now Correctly parses all standard header information when doing a screen preview.
''04Jun99 CFY Now generates the batch number fo CIVAS products before generating the labels
''            so that the number can be prointed on the label.
''07Jun99 SF  now opens/closes "patid.mdb" only once to speed up batch processing in repeat dispensing
''10Dec99 SF  now allows the maximum patients per ward to be ini file specified (default is the original 200)
''04Sep01 JN  added code to search wards for more than one patient type
''12oct01 CKJ Added separate frame for patient status & removed link between repeat dispensing and label types
''12Nov01 TH  Various changes to look up specific ward details if using patient specific search.
''   "        NB - quick changes for release - overhaul of this still required for 8.5 (#56702)
''14Feb02 TH  Added code to allow sort by consultant only if requested by user (option formally ignored) (#49045)
''25Feb02 TH  Changed to flag not to reference dispens.frm (#59050)
''15Oct02 TH  Added flag to stop translog write if manu issue and ActionEachDose has already been called (#)
''16Oct02 TH  Moved calls to promptBatchno on civas issue to point where the issue will take place (ie after checks on exclusions) (#)
''21OCt02 TH  Mod to suppress 'OK to print msg' (cant cancel at this point) and to add patient details to batchno prompt caption during manu issue
''13Nov02 CKJ Moved call to PromptBatchNumber inside ActionEachDose. Only allocate batchno when there is at least one dose to be handled.
''            If ActionEachDose finds that enough doses have been done already then it would have wasted that batchno
''            Added support for detecting whether a formula has been handled internally by manufacturing
''29Sep04 TH  Added mod to check each label and set to history if date past stop date. These labels will not now be processed.
''05Sep05 PJC/TH Added a test for AutoArchive to the logic in the If statement (#79161).
''12Jan07 PJC Added extra empty arguments to the call to PrintManWorksheet (enh77351).
