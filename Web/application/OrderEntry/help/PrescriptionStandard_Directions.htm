	<li>The <b>Directions</b> field is where the directions for administration should be entered.  It is split into
	two parts; the top part of the field is where preset directions are entered, and the bottom part is for any further free text.  
	Note that a preset direction MUST be entered, any extra free text is optional.</li>
	<li><b>Preset Directions</b> can be entered using the [...] button to the right of the field.  This displays a list of 
	appropriate coded directions from which one can be selected.</li>
	<li>To clear a direction which you have selected, either select another one or use the [X] button to the right of the field</li>
	<li>If required, <b>free text</b> can be entered in the box as required.</li>
	<li>Note that any instructions relating to the <i>supply</i> of the medication, rather than the administration of it,  should be entered into the &quot;Dispensing Instructions&quot;
	field</li>
