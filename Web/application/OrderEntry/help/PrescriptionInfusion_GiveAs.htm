<ul>
	<li>The &quot;Give As&quot; field allows you to choose between two options; <b>Bolus</b> and <b>Infusion Over</b></li>
	<li>Choosing <b>Bolus</b> means that the time over which the dose is to be infused is so short that the system can consider
	it to be instantaneous.  Use this option when the administration of the dose is considered to be a single action, in practice this 
	would include infusions given over a few minutes.</li>
	<li>Where the infusion is to be given over a longer period of time, and the person administering the dose would normally 
	set it up and then leave it infusing while they do something else, choose the <b>Infusion Over</b> option.  This allows you to 
	specify the time over which the dose should be infused.  Optionally, this can be specified as a range, for example &quot;20 to 30 minutes&quot;</li>
