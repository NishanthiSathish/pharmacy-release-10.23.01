<ul>
	<li>The <b>Duration</b> field on an infusion refers to the duration of the prescription, NOT the duration of the infusion.  It is only available
	when a repeating frequency is chosen (such as &quot;three times a day&quot;), and allows you to specify the number of days, weeks or months
	for which the prescription should run.</li>
	<li>The <i>duration of the infusion</i> is entered by selecting &quot;Infusion Over&quot; from the <b>Give As</b> box, then entering
	a time in the boxes next to it.</li>

</ul>
